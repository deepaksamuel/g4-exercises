# Simple training exercises in Geant4

source /snap/gate/45/usr/local/bin/geant4.sh

Installations:
VSCode
Python
Jupyter extension (on vscode)

All codes contain a README.md file and a analysis.py code to get started with the analysis.

For running examples, create a build folder inside the respective folders. Inside the build folder call `cmake ../` and then `make`. On successful compilation, you can run the examples by calling `./exampleB1`. 

Make sure you run `make` if you make any changes to the code or mac files.
