## Alpha particle scattering by gold foil
A alpha source of energy 4 MeV shot along the z direction from (0,0,-1*mm) hits  gold target of size 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 um. A sphere of inner radius 0.999 cm and outer radius 1 cm surrounds it, working as a detector.

The default world material is Air.

### Activities

a. Observe how many particles exit the target as a function of target thickness

b. Observe particles come out of the scattering:  
The PDG particle codes are here: https://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/reviews/montecarlorpp.pdf

  - alpha: 1000020000
  - electron: 11

c. What is the proportion of these particles?

d. What is energy of alpha particles?

d. What is energy of electrons?

e. Plot the angular distribution of the alpha particles.  
    - Roughly, what is the percentage of alpha particles that are reflected back.

f. Change the world material to Air and observe what happens to the trajectories. Qualitatively express your observations.  
    - Repeat the entire exercise with Air.
